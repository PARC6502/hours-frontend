It is envisaged it may enable volunteers and communities to build a profile, connect with funders and local authorities. Allowing people to share their accomplishments easier, measure them and remove some administrative burden to enable automatic reports and grant applications.
Theis site also leads towards an impact analysis that different audiences can evidence as a whole. Increasing the evidence base for mutual aid and voluntary labor which is underreported.
