This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Hours

## Intro

A react web application, in the early stages of development, that will allow users to log time spent contributing to community projects and charities and then exchange those hours for between each other or for goods and services.

Eventually the goal is to implement this as a cryptocurrency of sorts with smart contracts, maybe using some proof stake systems.

The project is under development at Foodhall, a grassroots community project based in Sheffield.

## Getting involved

We warmly welcome new participants.

- Please get in touch with us at [info@nationalfoodservice.uk](mailto:info@nationalfoodservice.uk)
- User stories are on [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/6yiDv1ZW/mutual-impact)
- We discuss development on the [National Food Service Slack](national-food-service.slack.com)
- If you're new to development in general, or React in particular, we can set you up with some scaffolded tasks to get started.

## Workflow

Our current development process is to:
1. Make changes locally on the [Code Sandbox image of the webapp]( https://codesandbox.io/s/mutual-impact-feed-mvdl7)
2. Create a Pull Request to this repo from the Code Sandbox image.
3. Netlify will deploy automatically once the Pull Request is approved.

## How to add a component
