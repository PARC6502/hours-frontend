This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Mutual Impact

## Intro

A react web application, in the early stages of development, that will allow users to log impact and contributions to community projects. Eventually the goal is to implement a system that enables bodies and funders to more easily support communities in relation to the people they have helped.


The project is under development as part of a National Food Service campaign, grassroots community projects across the country trying to solve food insecurity.

## Getting involved

We warmly welcome new participants.

- Please get in touch with us at [info@nationalfoodservice.uk](mailto:info@nationalfoodservice.uk)
- User stories are on [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/6yiDv1ZW/mutual-impact)
- We discuss development on the [National Food Service Slack](national-food-service.slack.com)
- If you're new to development in general, or React in particular, we can set you up with some scaffolded tasks to get started.

## Workflow

Our current development process is to:
1. Make changes locally on the [Code Sandbox image of the webapp]( https://codesandbox.io/s/mutual-impact-feed-mvdl7)
2. Create a Pull Request to this repo from the Code Sandbox image.
3. Netlify will deploy automatically once the Pull Request is approved.

## How to add a component
