This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Mutual Impact

## Intro

A react web application, in the early stages of development, that will allow users to log impact and contributions to community projects. Eventually the goal is to implement a currency or system that enables bodies and funders to more easily support communities in relation to the people they have helped.

The project is under development as part of a National Food Service campaign, grassroots community projects across the country trying to solve food insecurity.
